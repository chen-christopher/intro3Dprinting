# Final Project

For the final project, I created a ping pong table net clamp that utilizes a nut and bolt to screw it in place and a fishing line as the net. A photo of the net is attached below:

Halfway throughout modeling, I realized that it was not ideal to print out the net; it would require a lot of material and time. Thus, I decided to make small holes in the net clamp instead and use a fishing line to thread the holes. After talking with the professor, I also learned that it was not a good idea to 3D print the threading for the screw as the Ultimakers are not suitable for such precise work. To circumvent this, I decided to use nuts and bolt to lock the clamp in place. To do so, I created a hole that is slightly wider than the bolt so I could slide it in from the bottom easily. I then created a hexagonal hole on the other side so that I could put the nut in it, allowing the bolt to be locked in. 

After I printed the first net clamp, I realized that I printed it with the support material. This meant that the holes were filled, making it nearly impossible to remove. The holes for the net could be resolved using a drill and I used a drill press to create the hole for the bolt. However, I was stuck on removing the hole for the hexagonal nut. Having learned from this, I printed the second net clamp without support and it turned out perfectly fine. I was unable to print the net clamp again (without support) due to time constraints. 

I have attached the sketches and layout drawings below.
