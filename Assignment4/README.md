Final Project Ideation

1. Idea

Since we have a small table in our living room, I wanted to make a small table tennis set for it. This would involve a clamp, net(?), and potentially paddles.

2. Planning

I measured the the table and obtained the following measurements: 2cm in table thickness, 2cm in bar thickness, and 77cm in width. This table has its legs as one long metal bar that is attached directly below the edge of the table. Thus, instead of 2cm in table thickness, the net clamp should be at least 4cm thick to account for the bar as well. Additionally, I'm not sure if the printers are able to print long objects. If they are unable to print ~77cm in length, I should look for alternatie methods. I plan to make the clamp's net holder to be 1cm x 1cm x 8cm. The net should slide into the net holder and its length will be 75cm (to account for the net holder on both sides) in total. The breakdown of the net would be the part that slides into the net holder with measurements 1.2cm x 1.2cm x 8.2cm and the "net" will be 72.6 cm.
